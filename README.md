# Polylogic Kit

A modular Rust library suite for modeling diverse logical and philosophical reasoning systems.

## About

**Polylogic Kit** is a growing collection of Rust libraries designed to implement and interconnect various logical and dialectical reasoning frameworks. It provides a composable and extensible foundation for developers building applications that require structured reasoning, multi-perspective decision-making, or philosophical model simulation—such as in DAO governance, education, or complex systems design.

## Roadmap

Polylogic Kit will continue expanding to include more formal and deconstructive reasoning paradigms. Planned additions include:

- **Hegelian dialectics**: thesis → antithesis → synthesis
- **Post-structuralist models**: inspired by deconstruction and recursive critique
- **Other abstract or hybrid logic systems**: to support flexible and programmable discourse protocols

All additions will aim to interoperate with existing modules and follow a shared design philosophy of composable, symbolic reasoning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modular components. Each module focuses on a specific logical or metaphysical framework.

- `proto-wuxing`: Includes core implementations of:

  - The **Five Elements (Wuxing)** system (generation and control cycles)
  - **Yin-Yang** dualism
  - The **Ten Heavenly Stems** and **Twelve Earthly Branches** systems

These components provide symbolic primitives and operational logic for building more complex rule-based systems.

## Use Cases

Polylogic Kit is suitable for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

- Structuring multi-perspective discussion protocols in DAOs
- Modeling dynamic symbolic state transitions
- Designing logic-driven governance, ritual, or simulation frameworks
- Teaching abstract reasoning through programmable metaphysical systems
